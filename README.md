# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

## Overview

This Python script implements the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where two players choose from three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The game logic is implemented in a simple Python script, providing an interactive and fun way to play the game against the computer. Explore this script to understand the basic logic of the game and its implementation in Python.

## Script Components

- **Game Logic:** Implementation of the game rules and logic.
- **User Interaction:** Code for user input to make choices during the game.
- **Computer Opponent:** Code for the computer's random choice as the opponent.
- **Outcome Determination:** Logic to determine the winner based on the chosen options.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`rock_paper_scissors.py`) in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer will randomly choose its option, and the winner will be determined.

## Game Rules

- Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock.
- The game results in a tie if both the user and computer choose the same option.

## Customization

- Modify the script to include additional options or variations of the game.
- Experiment with the user input mechanism or the computer's decision-making logic.
